# Async Data Fetching

## Description

Fetch asynchronous data from an API".
Your task is to write a script or app, which gathers data from two endpoints asynchronously, merges the responses and displays them in any way, for example as JSON response from an REST API.
For example you could use these two endpoints:
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 to obtain a user's data
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1 to obtain all comments written by that user.
